            <small>With the successful landing, India also became the first country to land near Moon’s south pole</small>
            <p>With the successful landing of the Lander Module of ISRO’s third lunar mission Chandrayaan-3, India has reached the Moon! It has also became the first country to land near the Moon’s south pole.

                The Lander Module (LM) of the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) third lunar mission Chandrayaan-3, launched on July 14, made a successfully landing on the Moon’s surface on August 23, making India only the fourth country after the erstwhile USSR, the U.S. and China to make a soft landing on the lunar surface. Congratulating the team of scientists at ISRO, PM Modi said, “India’s successful moon mission is not India’s alone...Our approach of one earth, one family one future is resonating across the globe...Moon mission is based on the same human centric approach. So, this success belongs to all of humanity.”</p>

            <p>The Vikram lander has the capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover which will carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The Lander and the Rover have scientific payloads to carry out experiments on the lunar surface.</p>
